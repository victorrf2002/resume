    <h2>Music</h2>

    <p>
        As for many other people, music is one of those things that
        has helped me throughout some of the darkest and hardest parts
        of my life. My true love for music started back when the movie Baby Driver
        came out, which had a killer soundtrack featuring songs by Queen, Blur,
        Simon & Garfunkel, and many other amazing artists.

        From there, I delved more deeply into Rap, where I felt connected
        with artists like Kanye West, Kid Cudi, and Tyler, the Creator. This led me to explore
        music as an art and I felt heavily inspired to work on my own music, mainly through
        production, making beats on my PC with FL Studio.

        After mostly listening to Rap and R&B for the rest of High School and throughout College,
        I had an urge to get myself an acoustic guitar, which I did thanks to an old friend of mine.
        This was also the beginning of COVID-19, so I spent a large chunk of quarantine and lockdown
        learning how to play the guitar through YouTube (Thanks JustinGuitar!). This is also when I
        started to explore different genres of music, from Grunge to Pop Punk to Hyperpop to Rock n Roll.
        Since I was listening to a lot of subgenres of Rock and I was gaining experience playing the
        acoustic guitar, I decided to buy myself an electric guitar, a white Squier Stratocaster.

        It has now been 2 years since I have gotten my electric guitar, and 3 years since I have picked up
        the acoustic. Although I still have much to learn, I love to write my own songs and produce them
        on my computer. However, I do have a problem with finishing songs. Nonetheless, I will keep on writing
        and hope to one day make a whole album. Music is a passion for me and I cannot imagine a world where
        I won't be creating.

    <h2>Video Games</h2>

    <p>
        If someone were to ask me who my first true love was, I would say the GameBoy Advance SP. That was
        the first actual video game system I owned after my parents bought it for me when I was very young.
        I remember being hooked to games like Sonic and The Incredibles, until it unfortunately broke. Sometime
        after, my dad went on a business trip to Japan and he gifted me a Nintendo DS Lite when he came back.
        I remember being super excited about it when I was 6 years old and I would play with that thing constantly.
        My favourite DS games were from the Pokemon series, where I spent hours and hours collecting Pokemons and
        battling other trainers.

        As I got older, I was gifted more consoles and video games, such as the 3DS, the Xbox 360, and the PS4.
        Similar to music, I didn't only play video games to rewind, relax, and have fun, but also as an escape to
        various different worlds and stories. I have also spent countless hours on PC games, but my PC is too weak
        now to handle modern games. Nowadays, I mostly play on my PS5 and Nintendo Switch whenever I have the chance,
        but sometimes I can be too busy with more important tasks. However, I have much to thank for video games, as
        it gave me many hours of enjoyment and even friends. My decision to pursue Computer Science and programming
        is heavily influenced by gaming and I would love to someday work in this industry.
